    "### Automated Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the process of reading some text and determining the author's feelings (positive or negative) toward the subject on which they are writing. For example consider the following two movie reviews: \n",
    "\n",
    "- It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us.\n",
    "- A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue, betrayal, deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is pretty clear to us as human readers that the first review expresses a negative sentiment while the second one expresses a positive sentiment.  The task then for *automated sentiment analysis* is for the computer to take a piece of text and determine if is is expressing a positive or negative sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this might sound like a daunting task, there is a relatively clever way to do it if we have a large data set with words that have a known sentiment somehow already attached to them. As it turns out, there are lots and lots of such data sets. In fact, every review site on the the Internet has one:\n",
    "- \"5 stars: Loved it!\"\n",
    "- \"0 stars: Absolutely pathetic!\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea then is that these reviews can be used to associate a positive sentiment (\"5 stars\") the words \"Loved\" and \"it\" and a negative sentiment (\"0 stars\") to the words \"Absolutely\" and \"pathetic\". We'll get more into exactly how it will work below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set that we will use to assign sentiments is based on movie reviews and is from real movie reviews posted at [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).  This data set was originally produced for a [Kaggle machine learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/overview) and has since been adapted for a similar assignment by Eric D. Manley and Timothy M. Urness at Drake University.  It is their data set that we are using."

Add to that the fact that reading through a file is a relatively slow process by comparison to most operations the computer performs and the result is a slow program.
